layout: module
nav_order: 0301
summary: >-
  In this module, we'll learn about Razor patterns and features we can use to create responsive, reusable frontends, including partials, display templates and tag helpers. We'll also learn how to incorporate SCSS into our web application so we can use "syntactically awesome stylesheets" in our ASP.NET Core web apps.

So far, we've focused on backend development patterns -- HTTP endpoints, routing, databases, testing.

Time to shift our focus and look at some frontend presentation patterns.
