## Scaffolding Identity

ASP.NET Core ships with a full-featured identity provider which supports individual user registration and many external services.

When it comes to adding identity to your application, you can use the UI that's provided as part of the Identity package, you can override individual pages, or you can get the ASP.NET tooling to generate local copies of the entire identity system which you can customise as required.
