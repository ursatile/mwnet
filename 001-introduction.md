## Introduction

In this workshop, we're going to use .NET 7, C# and ASP.NET Core to build a web application for selling tickets to rock concerts.

I chose this scenario for several reasons. First, it's relatively simple to understand. Bands go on tour, they play shows in various different venues, maybe there's a support band or two on the same bill, but the business rules are fairly consistent from one show to the next.

Second, dealing with stage times and ticket prices at venues in different countries means we can't ignore real-world concerns like time zones and currency localization.

Third: I like rock bands.ü§òüèº
